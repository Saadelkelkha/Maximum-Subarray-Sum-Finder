# Maximum-Subarray-Sum-Finder
This program prompts the user to input nine numbers and calculates the maximum sum among all possible subarrays of four consecutive numbers. It initializes a list to store user inputs and iteratively collects these numbers. The program then identifies the subarray with the maximum sum, displaying both the specific subarray and the calculated sum.
